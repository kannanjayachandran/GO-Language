# Design Features of Go

* Go is a statically typed and compiled language with a garbage collector.

* Go does not have classes. Instead, it has structs.

* Go does not have inheritance. Instead, it has composition.

* Go does not have exceptions. Instead, it has error handling. Go has a data type called error that is used to handle errors.

* Go does not have generics. Instead, it has interfaces.

* Go does not have type casting. Instead, it has type assertions.
